# Real-Time Stock Market Data Pipeline


## Initial Idea
Description: Build a real-time stock market data pipeline that collects, processes, and streams stock prices to a dashboard or trading system.
Skills:
* Python for data ingestion and processing.
* C++ for high-performance data processing or trading execution logic.
* Kafka for real-time data streaming.
* AWS for cloud infrastructure, storage (S3), and data processing (Lambda, EC2).
* GraphQL for APIs

## Steps
1. Define the Data Flow and Requirements
* Data Sources: Identify where you will get stock market data. You could use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or any other reliable stock price data provider.
* Pipeline: Decide how data will flow from the source (API) to your final destination (dashboard or trading system).

2. Set Up Data Ingestion
* Use Python to handle data ingestion from stock APIs. Libraries like requests or yfinance can be used to fetch data.
* Periodically Fetch Data: Set up a cron job or a scheduler to fetch the stock data at regular intervals.
* Ensure that your Python script processes the data into a format suitable for streaming.

3. Set Up Kafka for Real-Time Streaming
* Install and configure Kafka to handle real-time data streaming. You can run Kafka locally or use a managed service like AWS MSK.
* Create Kafka topics to stream stock data.
* Use Pythonâ€™s confluent-kafka library to produce data to Kafka from your ingestion process.

4. Data Processing with C++ (if needed)
* If you need high-performance processing or trading execution, implement key parts of the pipeline (like algorithmic trading logic or complex calculations) in C++.
* Integrate your C++ code with Kafka to consume and process data in real-time.

5. Cloud Infrastructure on AWS
* Set up AWS infrastructure to host your data pipeline:
* S3: Store historical stock data or logs.
* Lambda: Use AWS Lambda for serverless processing, e.g., to process incoming data or trigger actions on data changes.
* EC2: Host your Kafka brokers and other services.
* Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.

6. Set Up GraphQL APIs
* Create GraphQL APIs to expose real-time stock data to a dashboard or trading system. You can use a framework like Apollo Server (in Node.js or Python) to set up your GraphQL server.
* Design your GraphQL schema for querying stock data, e.g., for querying stock prices, historical data, etc.

7. Building the Dashboard
* Create a simple React frontend that consumes your GraphQL APIs to display real-time stock prices.
* Use WebSockets for real-time updates, or rely on polling with GraphQL subscriptions to keep the dashboard up-to-date.

8. Testing & Optimization
* Test the entire pipeline for reliability, speed, and fault tolerance.
* Optimize for low latency, particularly for C++ processing and Kafka integration.
* Ensure that your AWS infrastructure scales appropriately based on load.

9. Documentation and Deployment

* Document the entire pipeline, architecture, and setup instructions.
* Deploy to AWS and ensure that the pipeline works end-to-end.

Tools & Libraries to Explore:
* Python: requests, yfinance, pandas, confluent-kafka
* C++: Kafka C++ client (e.g., librdkafka)
* Kafka: Apache Kafka
* AWS: Lambda, EC2, MSK, S3, CloudWatch
* GraphQL: Apollo Server, Graphene (for Python)
